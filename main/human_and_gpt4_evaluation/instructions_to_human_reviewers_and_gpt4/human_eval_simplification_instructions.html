<big>Human evaluation of text simplification</big> <div style="height: 15px;" />IMPORTANT INFORMATION: We are conducting this research on the quality of text simplification, summarization, and grammatical error correction. We will start from text simplification. You will be asked to read some short texts and their simplified versions and rate them according to some criteria which are specified below. Some of the content you will see is human generated, other is AI generated, but you will not be told which is which as this is a blind research. As the interface is not mobile / tablet friendly, we ask that you complete this study using a laptop or desktop. This research is divided into 3 parts taking about 4, 8 and 4 hours respectively (around 16 hours in total). You should only start working on this research if you can at least commit for the first part (4 hours). To make things simpler, we are splitting these 4 hours into 4 separate studies taking about one hour each, which you can take on separate days. All these 4 one-hour studies should be completed by the end of Thursday 4th May. This is study part 1 of 4. A link to the following 3 studies will be sent once you have accepted this commitment. Base pay is Â£12 per hour. Once you've completed the first 4 one-hour studies, we will review the work, and if of a satisfactory quality, we will award a 10% discretionary bonus and invite you to take part to the two remaining parts of the study which will require a longer time commitment. You can decide not to continue with the research after you have completed the first 4 one-hour studies. Work will be reviewed as it comes through during UK working hours (excluding weekends and bank holidays). If at any point you have any questions or we have anything we'd like to communicate, feel free to message us through the Prolific messaging service, we will also use it if we need to get in touch, and potentially to discuss continuation of your work into the following studies. <div style="height: 15px;" /> <ul>  In the study you're about to start, which we estimate should take one hour, you will be shown 25 pieces of text taken mostly from older news articles. Alongside each of them, you will be shown 4 different possible simplified versions of the text. The purpose of text simplification can be varied, but include things such as making the text easier to read, more accessible to language learners, or explaining a medical or legal text in plain speak. We ask that you carefully read the original text and rank each of the 4 simplifications according to the following metrics, which are defined below. <div style="height: 10px;" /> A simplification box would look as follows (you will have 4 of these per source text) <head><style>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .imgbox {display: grid; height: 100%;} .center-fit { max-width: 100%; max-height: 100vh; margin: auto;}</style></head><body><div class="imgbox"><img class="center-fit" src='simplification_screenshot.png'></div></body>  <strong>NOTE: please take a screeshot of this page for your future reference as you may not be able to access it again once you start the survey.</strong><div style="height: 15px;" /> <ul>           <li>                <p><strong>Semantics (or adequacy)</strong> </p> This assesses whether the meaning of the text is preserved further to the simplification. Semantic preservation is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Meaning Not Preserved) to 5 (Meaning fully preserved). NOTE: You should penalize simplified text which is not self contained. For example, if the sentence <em>"Scientists have no idea how eels protect their own brain and muscles from being damaged by electricity"</em> is simplified as <em>"Scientists have no idea how they stay safe"</em>, this should be rated around 2 out of 5 as it is not possible by just reading the simplified version to understand what "they" is referring to. Like wise if the simplified text contains hallucinations (facts not contained in the source) it should be penalised. For example if <em>"He yelled"</em> is simplified as <em>"His father Russell shouted"</em> this should be rated around 2 under this category. The omission of some unimportant details from the source into the simplified version is acceptable at your discretion, if the text meaning is preserved. </li> <div style="height: 15px;" /> <li> <p><strong>Grammaticality (or fluency)</strong></p>This assesses whether the simplified text remains grammatical and understandable. Sentences should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. Grammaticality / Fluency is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Fluent) to 5 (Super Fluent)</li>  <div style="height: 15px;" /> <li> <p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p> This assesses whether the simplified text, considered in its entirety, is simpler than the source text. Simplicity is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (text is significantly more complex than the source) to 5 (text is significantly simpler than the source, or no further simplification was possible).  Note that sometimes you may see that the version which is supposed to be simplified is instead exactly identical to the source. In these cases, use your judgment, and if it is a very short sentence which cannot be simplified further, for example <em>"How are you?"</em>, then even if the text is not simpler than the source, it may be appropriate to assign a score of 5. A score of 3 is appropriate for cases where the text was not simplified nor made more complex, but potential for simplification exists. </li> <div style="height: 15px;" />  <div style="height: 10px;" />  </ul></ul> <strong>NOTE: please take a screeshot of this page for your future reference as you may not be able to access it again once you start the survey.</strong> <div style="height: 5px;" />  This one-hour study will start on the next page and comprises 25 pages.
