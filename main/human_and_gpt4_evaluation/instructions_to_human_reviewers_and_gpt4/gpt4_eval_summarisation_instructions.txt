You're GPT4 and are about to start a task where you will be shown some pieces of text taken mostly from older news articles, alongside 4 different possible summaries of each text, and you will be asked to evaluate the quality of the summaries based on some metrics defined below. The purpose of text summarization is to make the text shorter and more concise without changing its overall meaning, omitting unimportant details while retaining the key content of the story. We ask that you carefully read the original text and rank each of the 4 summaries according to the following metrics, which are defined below.

Relevance. This assesses the quality of selection of important content from the source. The summary should include only important information from the source document. Please penalize summaries which contain redundancies and excess information. Relevance is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Relevant) to 5 (Super Relevant)

Fluency. This assesses the quality of individual sentences. Sentences in the summary should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read. Fluency is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Fluent) to 5 (Super Fluent)

Coherence. This assesses the collective quality of all sentences. The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic. Coherence is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Coherent) to 5 (Super Coherent)

Consistency. This assesses the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Summaries that contain hallucinated facts (information which is not present in the source document) should be penalized. Consistency is assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Not Consistent) to 5 (Super Consistent)

We will pass you the input you need to rank in json format.
Please reply with the scores in json format.
This is an example json query where "original_input" is the source text, "id" is the unique identifier, and all other keys represent output texts which you need to evaluate.
{"original_input": "(CNN)Love it or hate it, Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker is an internet sensation.

Your answer should contain the id and the scores, for example, using the example given above, if you wish to give gold_reference a relevance score of 2, a fluency score of 5, a coherence score of 4 and a consistency score of 4, and you wish to give bigscience/T0pp a relevance score of 3, a fluency score of 5, a coherence score of 1 and a consistency score of 3,  and you wish to give text-davinci-003 a relevance score of 5, a fluency score of 4, a coherence score of 3 and a consistency score of 4, and you wish to give gpt-3.5-turbo a relevance score of 4, a fluency score of 3, a coherence score of 5 and a consistency score of 3, then you should return the following output (note how the id item needs to be preserved to allow for identification):
{"gold_reference": {"relevance": 2, "fluency": 5, "coherence": 4, "consistency": 4}, "bigscience/T0pp": {"relevance": 3, "fluency": 5, "coherence": 1, "consistency": 3}, "text-davinci-003": {"relevance": 5, "fluency": 4, "coherence": 3, "consistency": 4}, "gpt-3.5-turbo": {"relevance": 4, "fluency": 3, "coherence": 5, "consistency": 3}, "id": "49f45c17ee34e2aa420ef557d944a6f2df96f5226c2793e4a9d379c517fde9a5"}
