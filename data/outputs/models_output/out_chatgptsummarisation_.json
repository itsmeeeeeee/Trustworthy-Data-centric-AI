David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy . The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute.

According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, the bodies were found wrapped in plastic inside the freezer by a bailiff performing a court ordered eviction on March 24. The Wayne County medical examiner has since determined that Stoni died from multiple blunt trauma injuries and Stephen from multiple blunt trauma and thermal injuries. Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013.

Uno, just three weeks old, and Louie, a full-grown dog, were together at home in Spokane, Washington, earlier this month. The clip begins with one of the Pogue family, who recently adopted Uno, tentatively holding him before the two pets are introduced. Adorable: Louie, a full-grown Dalmatian, is shown here snuggling with Uno, a three-week old kitten . After carefully saying hello to Louie's left forepaw, Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine's front legs.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as \"spice\" or \"K2.\" \"Spice\" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. \"Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body,\" acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to \"mask its true purpose,\" the health department statement said. \"Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,\" New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. \"They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.\" The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with \"spice\" in the previous month. Mobile County alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far, more than the entire previous year, the statement said. Mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise. Ninety-seven  cases over an eight-day span in April were reported to the Mississippi Poison Control Center, a Department of Health press release said.", "Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences while keeping the key information intact.\n**Important:** Output only the final summary, without explanations or bullet points.\n\nText: New York (CNN)New York state authorities have issued a health alert following a dramatic spike in hospital visits for synthetic marijuana-related emergencies.

Superman: Dawn of Justice\" just got a makeover. Soon after the trailer went up late on Friday, YouTuber Bobby Burns got to work on doing his own version using classic superhero footage. Instead of Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill facing off, this version wonders what it would be like if comics' classic characters Adam West and Christopher Reeve took their places. CNN spoke to 18-year-old Burns about what motivated him to make his now-viral video. (Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio behind \"Batman v. Superman,\" is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN.) CNN: When did you start making YouTube videos like this? Burns: At age 11. I work for the Made In Network in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Where did this idea come from? Burns: I'm pretty hyped for \"Batman v. Superman.\" As soon as I saw the trailer, my brain immediately went to the classic \"Batman\" [TV series] and I thought how funny it would be if this film was made at the time. CNN: What were you looking to accomplish? Burns: I wanted to contrast the old with the new. CNN: What kind of reaction have you received? Burns: Within an hour of the trailer going up, I went to work on the edit. Within four hours, my edit was finished and up on the Internet. The reaction has been great!

At first everything appears to be in order until the dog gets up and walks into another room, prompting the video maker to laugh even harder. Stains' coat was cut to resemble a lion's when its owners sent it to the groomers to get a trim .

But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of \"All-New X-Men\" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. \"There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,\" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. \"The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told.\" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the \"All-New X-Men\" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women \"hot,\" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the \"X-Men\" films, as well as the 1981 animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.\" The \"X-Men\" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: \"i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...\"", "Summarize the following text in 2-3 sentences while keeping the key information intact.\n**Important:** Output only the final summary, without explanations or bullet points.\n\nText: (CNN)He's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning.

The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years.

Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children. The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said. The male carried a sign with a message about \"social justice,\" authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the \"1%.\" Dine said there was \"no nexus to terrorism\" apparent so far in this incident. The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings. The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall. Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said. After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed. Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police. Many tourists at the scene were filming at the time and showed their photos and video to investigating law enforcement officers.

Shi Chao, a student at the\u00a0Hunan University of Science and Technology, saw the cloud - which appeared to perfectly mimick the global symbol for wifi - on his way from to the library around 7pm last Friday. Later the Weibo account of Hunan University put out jokes using the photo with lines such as 'Technology University now has a giant Wifi Cloud. Have our students got online yet? I won't tell you the password XXXXXXXXXX!' Chinese internet users have since shared and commented on Shi's photo thousands of times on Chinese social media.

The jury was not aware of what had happened outside the courthouse when they decided they could not reach a verdict in the 75-year-old's case, according to New England Cable News. John Goodwin, 75, killed himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student . Prosecutors said that Goodwin, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted an 11-year-old student from 2002 to 2005. The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. Goodwin's lawyer, Joe Welsh, acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but said he didn't commit a crime. 'He did hug his student, rubbed his back, massage,' said Welsh. 'It's not a crime. Whether it's appropriate, that's different.' Goodwin's trial began Monday. The jury had been deliberating for two hours when Goodwin shot himself around 11am. He was not in custody at the time of the shooting.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment.

Swedish scientists analysed more than 10,000 families with children aged two to 14 who did not have the condition, looking at whether there was any family conflict, a change of family structure, interventions from social services or unemployment. Subsequently, 58 children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The researchers found many were among those badly affected by events in their formative years.

CCTV footage shows the thieves in action at the Shell fuel stop along Ygnacio Valley Road in Walnut Creek. While one man distracts a cashier at the window, another leads a cable from the back of a white pickup to the cash machine. Once the cord is attached, the vehicle in the background speeds off and uproots the ATM from its mount. Sparks are caught flying into the air as the large device is dragged across the tarmac. The man who was previously  talking to the gas station clerk then runs towards the truck. He is seen wearing a bright red beanie, black pants, sweat top and sneakers.

Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said. \"As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured,\" said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F.

Bayern Munich players celebrate in front of their fans after the 6-1 demolition of Porto on Tuesday night . Pep Guardiola looks animated as he issues instructions from the touchline at the Allianz Arena . 'It's easy to love my players now,' said Guardiola. 'I am the coach of extraordinary players. I didn't expect such a first half.' Typical of the man though, Guardiola found faults in Bayern's second half performance as Porto pulled back to 5-1 before Xabi Alonso added a late sixth. 'We can still play better,' he added. 'We lost the ball here and there and we can improve on that. We had a few problems in the second half. 'They had only a few chances but you should never relax in the Champions League.' Guardiola talks to captain Philipp Lahm (third right) as Mario Gotze (far left), Thiago and Thomas Muller listen in .

Bayern find out their semi-final opponents on Thursday with Guardiola's former club Barcelona already through to the last four and the winners of Real Madrid v Atletico Madrid and Monaco v Juventus to join them in the draw.

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal.

Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality.

It is understood a group of eight contracted workers broke into the 52-metre slide after it was closed earlier in the night due to fears the heavy rain would make the slide particularly slippery. Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation.

Wilshere has been forced to miss five months of this season following ankle surgery in November, but the  England midfielder is closing in on a return to full fitness. Before that long-awaited return to first-team duty, and before loading the boot of his car, the 23-year-old was keen to share his staple food requirements with his 891,000 instagram followers.

As the camera zoomed in, live footage showed firefighters plucking a tiny black kitten from the edges of the smoldering blaze. It's behind you: WPLG reporter Roger Lohse had almost finished an unremarkable report on a fire when it was pointed out that a kitten was being rescued behind him . Noticing: Lohse's cameraman pointed out the rescue to him, and he went to investigate . As Lohse noticed the live rescue, he ran over to two firefightings holding the lost kitten in a towel, and asked where it had been found. A firefighter who had the animal in her hands said that the tiny pet had been hiding from the fire in an empty Modelo beer box. Lohse signed off his noon report by saying: 'Look at that! Not only did they put out the fire, but we just had the rescue here. How about that - that's a great story'. Later in the day, WPLG reported that the blaze was mostly contained, and that fire fighters hoped that forecast rain would put an end to it completely.

According to Detroit Police Chief James Craig, the bodies were found wrapped in plastic inside the freezer by a bailiff performing a court ordered eviction on March 24. The Wayne County medical examiner has since determined that Stoni died from multiple blunt trauma injuries and Stephen from multiple blunt trauma and thermal injuries. Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013. A message left for Blair's court appointed attorney, who entered not guilty pleas on her behalf at her arraignment, wasn't immediately returned. In addition to the two counts of premeditated murder -- each of which carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole --  Blair, 35, has been charged with two counts of torture, four counts of felony child abuse and one count of committing child abuse in the presence of another child. She has two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, both of whom are now in in protective custody, according to Worthy.

Uno, just three weeks old, and Louie, a full-grown dog, were together at home in Spokane, Washington, earlier this month. The clip begins with one of the Pogue family, who recently adopted Uno, tentatively holding him before the two pets are introduced. Adorable: Louie, a full-grown Dalmatian, is shown here snuggling with Uno, a three-week old kitten . After carefully saying hello to Louie's left forepaw, Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine's front legs. Louie then shifts his position, giving Uno the chance to nuzzle and lick his neck, before settling down underneath one of his floppy ears. After Uno noses his way forward so the two creatures' faces are side by side, Louie turns his head and nuzzle his new companion lovingly. Throughout the exchange Louie's mother, whom the family adopted at the same time as the kitten, looks on approvingly. According to the Pogue family, their dog has a great track record with kittens. When they have adopted young animals previously, a hug with the Dalmatian has been a rite of passage as they join the family.

Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to \"mask its true purpose,\" the health department statement said. \"Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,\" New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. \"They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain.\" The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with \"spice\" in the previous month.

But Curle was demonstrably cynical as to their chances. 'There's no spirit in this changing room,' he said.

At first everything appears to be in order until the dog gets up and walks into another room, prompting the video maker to laugh even harder. Stains' coat was cut to resemble a lion's when its owners sent it to the groomers to get a trim . The filmmaker laughs throughout the video and the other dogs in the house approach Stains as if checking out his new look . Shaved from the front legs back, the dog boasts a voluminous mane around its head and neck and looks somewhat majestic.

The SPFL young player of the month for March, 19-year-old Denayer is wanted back at parent club Manchester City for a pre-season assessment. Keen to pursue a first-team breakthrough after making his international debut for Belgium last month, doubts over the future of Manuel Pellegrini may yet hand the Parkhead the chance of a second loan deal. Jason Denayer (left) is wanted back by Manchester City for pre-season to be assessed by their staff . But Deila admits that won\u2019t happen in time for the first Champions League qualifier on July 16. \u2018City want Jason back for pre-season to see what kind of level he is at and where he stands and get the group together and maybe he will be loaned out again or he will stay. That is up to Jason and the manager,\u2019 Deila explained. \u2018We will see what happens - but it is very hard just now. We will look for a central defender anyway, one maybe two.\u2019 Ronny Deila confirmed that the defender would be missing for the Champions League qualifers in July . Denayer remains non-committal on the prospect of an extended loan deal and added: \u2018I only try to focus my mind on what is happening at Celtic and try to do my best for them. I always try to give my best level for Celtic, that\u2019s what I need to do if I\u2019m to reach the highest level in football . \u2018I haven\u2019t spoken to Patrick Vieira or anyone at City but I hope they are happy with my progress. \u2018I feel that I have improved a lot from the start of the season, I\u2019m a more mature player and my style of play is also different from when I first arrived. \u2018Some of the strikers I come up against in Scotland are big and strong.

I didn't know if anyone was hurt.\" Barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary Scott, co-lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on Instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. \"Thanking God for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,\" she wrote. The tour manager told CNN affiliate KTVT that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an Instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her Bible.

This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told.\" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the \"All-New X-Men\" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women \"hot,\" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the \"X-Men\" films, as well as the 1981 animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends.\" The \"X-Men\" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: \"i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...\"", "(CNN)He's been part of a wildly popular superhero team since its very beginning.

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.", "Hong Kong (CNN)Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media.

Given's performances in the FA Cup have given Sherwood plenty to consider as the Villa manager looks to pick up the points required to stay in the top-flight, beginning with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday evening. Shay Given celebrates Aston Villa's 2-1 victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzen lost out to Given for the Liverpool clash and is set to lose out again for the final . 'Shay comes in every day and trains hard,' said goalkeeping coach Tony Parks. 'He's fully behind Guz when he plays in the league team and he puts pressure on him. If Guz isn't playing well then Shay will be back in the team. 'The reverse comes in the cup. Brad hurts, Brad wants to play at Wembley in the semi-final but like he said to me, it's all about the bigger picture. 'He understands that Shay has earned the right to play in these games and that Shay has earned the right to stay in the team for the Cup final. I don't see that really being a question.'

Initially he thought they had wiggled their way through the snow, but dismissed this when he realised it was up to a metre deep in some places.

An unidentified male walked through a public area on the west front of the Capitol early Saturday afternoon and shot himself, Dine told reporters. Witnesses told CNN dozens of shocked onlookers watched, including some young children. The unidentified shooter had a backpack and a rolling suitcase that authorities treated as treated suspicious packages, prompting the lockdown as they were investigated, Capitol police said. The male carried a sign with a message about \"social justice,\" authorities said. A witness, Robert Bishop, told CNN it also said something about taxing the \"1%.\" Dine said there was \"no nexus to terrorism\" apparent so far in this incident. The building and the nearby Capitol Visitors Center were locked down, meaning tourists or any staff could not enter or leave the buildings. The Capitol area was crowded with tourists taking in the Cherry Blossom trees, which are in full bloom along the National Mall. Members of the Capitol police force, which responded to the scene, did not fire their weapons, Dine said. After the suspicious packages were examined, the lockdown was lifted about 3:50 p.m. ET and pedestrian traffic was allowed. Responding to the incident were the Metropolitan Police Department, which is investigating the death, as well as the FBI, Secret Service and Park Police.

Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday. Massung says the sharks were still out in the water on Friday, but the conditions weren't clear enough to photograph the scene.

Luckily, so far it looks like no one was hurt. With tornadoes touching down near Dallas on Sunday, Ryan Shepard snapped a photo of a black cloud formation reaching down to the ground. He said it was a tornado. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say it looked half a mile wide. More like a mile, said Jamie Moore, head of emergency management in Johnson County, Texas. It could have been one the National Weather Service warned about in a tweet as severe thunderstorms drenched the area, causing street flooding. \"To repeat--tornadoes (yes, two) likely W and E of Rio Vista. The one to the E of Rio Vista is a large, damaging tornado,\" the NWS tweeted. Luckily, it tore through countryside, and there have been no reports of deaths. But surveyors had not been out to check for damage or casualties overnight because the weather was so bad, Moore said. There are reports of damage -- including many roofs ripped off -- in Rio Vista and Grandview, both outliers of Fort Worth. On social media, images circulated of flipped 18-wheelers. Tempestuous clouds created dangerous, awe-inspiring funnels and disks as a front swept through. Residents reported hail the size of softballs and posted photos as proof.", "(CNN)If that was a tornado, it was one monster of one. Luckily, so far it looks like no one was hurt.

The jury was not aware of what had happened outside the courthouse when they decided they could not reach a verdict in the 75-year-old's case, according to New England Cable News. John Goodwin, 75, killed himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student . Prosecutors said that Goodwin, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted an 11-year-old student from 2002 to 2005. The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. Goodwin's lawyer, Joe Welsh, acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but said he didn't commit a crime. 'He did hug his student, rubbed his back, massage,' said Welsh. 'It's not a crime. Whether it's appropriate, that's different.' Goodwin's trial began Monday. The jury had been deliberating for two hours when Goodwin shot himself around 11am. He was not in custody at the time of the shooting.

The former student testified he didn't come forward until 2013 because he was embarrassed, according to WMUR. Goodwin's lawyer, Joe Welsh, acknowledged his client was 'touchy-feely,' but said he didn't commit a crime. 'He did hug his student, rubbed his back, massage,' said Welsh. 'It's not a crime.

As his Wigan side beat Warrington 30-20, the Wales forward made his first appearance since he punched St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the opening moments of last season's Grand Final, earning a six-month ban. The 27-year-old, who came on as a substitute in the 23rd minute of Thursday's match, told the Daily Star Sunday: 'I was surprised how calm I was, with everything going through my head about doing the right things. Ben Flower does not believe he deserved the standing ovation which greeted his return from suspension . 'But I didn't expect such a big loud roar and a standing ovation. For the fans to stick by me like that is a credit to them. 'It was lovely for them to do that but at the end of the day I do not deserve that because I let the club down massively.' Ahead of Flower's return, coach Shaun Wane had said he wanted to see him come back an even more aggressive player, but Flower said he needed to learn how to manage his emotions.

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment.

The 40-year-old rapper from St. Louis, who shot to fame 15 years ago with the track \"Country Grammar,\" has been charged with felony possession of drugs, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security said. The state trooper stopped the bus carrying Nelly and five other people on Interstate 40 in Putnam County on Saturday because it wasn't displaying U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers, according to Tennessee authorities. The trooper was about to conduct an inspection of the bus, a Prevost motor coach, when he \"noticed an odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle,\" authorities said in a statement. Two troopers then searched the bus, finding \"five colored crystal-type rocks that tested positive for methamphetamine, as well as a small amount of marijuana and other drug paraphernalia,\" the statement said. The search also turned up several handguns and 100 small Ziploc bags, which the statement said are commonly used for selling drugs. The guns included a gold-plated .50-caliber Desert Eagle pistol, a .45-caliber Taurus pistol and a .500 Smith & Wesson magnum. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Haynes, was taken to the Putnam County Jail along with another passenger. He later posted bond and left the jail, the Putnam County Sheriff's Office said.

But they are still lagging behind their stay-at-home female partners when it comes to sharing the burden. Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives . The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement. The research noted the increase in the men's hours was mainly taken up by more 'manly' chores - like repairs and gardening.

'Brazilians like to have fun with their football, which hasn\u2019t happened to Oscar very much recently, but I met Jose Mourinho and he spoke highly of all his Brazilian players. 'I tell Allegri that Oscar is strong and also a good lad. A forward line with him, Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata would drive any Coach crazy. 'It wouldn\u2019t be a step backwards for Oscar to go to Juventus. He\u2019d be decisive in Serie A and whether he plays for Juventus or Chelsea it\u2019ll always be a great club.'

Genetic predisposition remains the most important factor, with a 12-fold increase in the risk of developing type 1 diabetes for a child from a family in which another close family member has it. The majority of people have type 2 diabetes, which is associated with being overweight, but more than 95 per cent of cases of diabetes in children are type 1 and rates have been increasing in recent years.", "Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Swedish scientists analysed more than 10,000 families with children aged two to 14 who did not have the condition, looking at whether there was any family conflict, a change of family structure, interventions from social services or unemployment. Subsequently, 58 children were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The researchers found many were among those badly affected by events in their formative years. Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes (stock image above) The team at Linkoping University said that while the causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, it is usually preceded by the body\u2019s immune system killing so-called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. They suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Other factors include viral infection, dietary habits, birth weight and early weight gain. The study concluded: \u2018The experience of a serious life event during the first 14 years of life may be a risk factor.

Students on the Kikuyu campus stampeded down the halls of the Kimberly dormitory, and some jumped from its fifth floor, the university said. Hundreds were injured and were taken to hospitals. One person died, according to the school. The confusion and panic came less than two weeks after Al-Shabaab slaughtered 147 people at a college in Garissa, Kenya. Kenyan teachers and students have said they fear being targeted by the Somalia-based terrorists. On Sunday, as many as 108 students from the University of Nairobi were admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital. Among them, at least 63 students have been discharged, and at least four are slated for surgery, the school said. Almost all of the 54 students being treated at PCEA Kikuyu Hospital have been released, the university said. Kenya Power authorities and its CEO are at the school and looking into the electrical issue. Normal power supply will resume after repairs, the university said. \"As we mourn the unfortunate loss of the departed student, we are also praying for the quick recovery of those who were injured,\" said Vice Chancellor Peter M.F.

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There\u2019s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we\u2019re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets.

Forest manager Dougie Freedman failed in a bid to sign the 25-year-old on loan with view to a permanent deal in March as Blackburn rebuffed interest from Forest, Derby, Norwich and Middlesbrough.

It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital. The slide underwent a safety check Sunday morning and was cleared for use, as long as there wasn't another downpour. The thrill seekers were travelling at such great speeds they were unable to stop eventually running into a barricade at the bottom of the slide . Mr Collins said although he hopes the employees have a quick recovery, it was their disregard for safety instructions that got themselves into this situation.

Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip.\" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing \"in an eco-sensitive manner,\" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.", "A pub landlord who was convicted of drink driving after claiming he was sleepwalking and was not drunk has vowed to never drink again.

Twenty-three people had minor injuries after Flight 162 landed at 8:05 p.m., according to fire department and ministry sources. There were 73 passengers and eight crew members -- including five cabin attendants, two pilots and a maintenance official -- aboard when the flight took off from South Korea's Incheon International Airport at 6:34 p.m. local time, Asiana said in a statement late Tuesday. Authorities are investigating initial reports that the Airbus A320 may have hit an object on the runway during landing, causing damage to the rear of its body and the cover of the engine on the left wing, the ministry said. Video of the scene showed the aircraft's body turned around, with its nose pointing in the direction that the plane had come from.
