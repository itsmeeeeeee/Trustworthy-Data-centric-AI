The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. Christian churches across Egypt stormed, torched .

Both were determined to be homicides, according to spokesman Ryan Bridges. According to CNN affiliate WDIV,  investigators believe Stephen was scalded with hot water, beaten and strangled in August 2012, while Stoni was killed in May 2013. A message left for Blair's court appointed attorney, who entered not guilty pleas on her behalf at her arraignment, wasn't immediately returned. In addition to the two counts of premeditated murder -- each of which carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole --  Blair, 35, has been charged with two counts of torture, four counts of felony child abuse and one count of committing child abuse in the presence of another child.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that more than 160 patients in nine days have been rushed to hospitals across the state for adverse reactions to synthetic cannabinoid, known as ""spice"" or ""K2."" ""Spice"" and other similar synthetic drugs are often marketed as legal plant material coated with chemicals that are supposed to mimic the effects of marijuana, according to a statement from the governor's office. ""Since the exact compounds contained in synthetic cannabinoid products change so frequently, it's often impossible for users to know exactly what they are putting in their body,"" acting New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said. Symptoms after use have a wide range of severity, from confusion, drowsiness and headaches to increased heart rate, seizures and loss of consciousness, according to the New York State Department of Health. Synthetic marijuana is popular among teens because it is marketed as incense or natural products to ""mask its true purpose,"" the health department statement said. ""Young people may be fooled into thinking that these substances are safe because they are sold over the counter or are in colorful packaging, but they are not made for human consumption,"" New York Alcohol and Substance Abuse Service s Commissioner Arlene Gonzalez Sanchez said. ""They are dangerous and can have significant, long-term effects on the brain."" The recent surge is not isolated in New York; other states across the country have noticed similar trends. Alabama Department of Public Health issued a statement last week acknowledging a rise of synthetic marijuana usage and said there had been 98 overdoses suspected to be linked with ""spice"" in the previous month. Mobile County alone has seen seven cases in 2015 so far, more than the entire previous year, the statement said. Mississippi health officials are also concerned that synthetic marijuana is on the rise. Ninety-seven  cases over an eight-day span in April were reported to the Mississippi Poison Control Center, a Department of Health press release said.","New York reports 160 hospitalizations related to synthetic marijuana .

But there's something we never knew about Bobby Drake, aka Iceman of the X-Men. Wednesday's issue of ""All-New X-Men"" No. 40 reveals the truth: Bobby is gay. ""There are thousands if not millions of stories of people who, for many different reasons, felt the need to hide their sexuality,"" Brian Michael Bendis, who wrote the issue, said in a statement to CNN. ""The X-Men, with the conceit of time travel, give us a fascinating platform in which to examine such personal journeys. This is just the first little chapter of a much larger story that will be told."" Iceman's outing happens in an unusual manner. In the ""All-New X-Men"" storyline, members of the X-Men team travel to the past, as younger versions of themselves. Mind-reading mutant Jean Grey (also an X-Men original) asks Bobby why he calls women ""hot,"" when she knows he is gay. In comic book pages provided to CNN, Bobby doesn't immediately acknowledge that she is telling the truth. The character of Iceman is perhaps best known for his appearances in many of the ""X-Men"" films, as well as the 1981 animated series ""Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends."" The ""X-Men"" series of comics have long been progressive in terms of diversity, with a black female character, Storm, appearing in the 1970s, and the first gay mainstream comic book character, Northstar (who later married in the pages). DC Comics has also had prominent gay characters in recent years, like Batwoman and the original Green Lantern of Earth 2. Catwoman recently came out as bisexual, and Harley Quinn is portrayed that way as well. Bendis further shared his thoughts on Twitter about the attention surrounding the story when it leaked on Tuesday: ""i swear on my dogs, i wanted the issue to come out and just be. no press. no sensational headlines. no leaks. oh, well...""","""X-Men"" original character Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake is revealed to be gay in latest issue .

The plant, located in Zhangzhou city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment, Xinhua news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the Zhangzhou fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in China, the construction of PX plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The Zhangzhou plant was slated for Xiamen -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.","A blast rocks a chemical plant in China's southeastern Fujian province for the second time in two years .

b3058764d4a1f4f1c3f29f3a945180376eccb1095aff1547d1ea229eac3cbb1f,"Tokyo (CNN)A second robotic probe sent into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has captured images of a strange green glow. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. ""It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,"" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an ""unprecedented"" experiment. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo, Japan and Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong.","A robotic probe into the Fukushima nuclear plant released crucial information on conditions inside the reactor .

Division of labour: Men do just two hours of housework a day while working, which increases to 3.9 after they retire - but it is still far less than the amount carried out by their stay-at-home wives . The study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, found women who did not work did an average of 6.8 hours before their husband's retired. Chores included doing the laundry and the washing up, as well as running errands, according to New York Magazine. However, the number of hours they did each day only dropped to 6.1 after their husbands retired. What's more, it seems the men were still avoiding the washing up, even post-retirement.

Children who experience stressful events such as a death or illness in the family, divorce or separation, could be three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes (stock image above) The team at Linkoping University said that while the causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, it is usually preceded by the body’s immune system killing so-called beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. They suggested damaging events in childhood could affect beta cells and raise insulin demands to cope with elevated levels of stress hormones. Other factors include viral infection, dietary habits, birth weight and early weight gain.

Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was looking to improve on the Internet-connected device, which was trumpeted as a huge technological leap forward when it was announced in 2012. However, Google stopped selling the first version and shut its pre-launch Explorer program for Google Glass earlier this year, prompting speculation about the demise of the wearable gadget before it became widely available. Massimo Vian, one of the heads of Milan-based Luxottica, said that his team was working on two new versions of Google Glass, one of which was 'in preparation' Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt later appointed a new leader for the product and said that it would be 'ready for users', according to the Wall Street Journal. 'There’s nothing about adjusting Glass that suggests we’re ending it,' he said. Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'. He did not give any details about a proposed launch date for the second version. The executive has recently been to California to meet with Google's team. New versions of Google Glass, which was unveiled three years ago as a prototype available for $1,500, are thought to aim at a lower cost, longer battery life and improved sound quality. It officially offered the product to the public in 2014, though sales were low. Vian (pictured) told shareholders of his company, which makes Ray Bans, that there were 'some second thoughts' about what version three of Google Glass would be. Part of the perceived failure of the first version of the product was the mockery it generated towards 'glassholes' who wore the odd-looking gadgets. 'There are some second thoughts on how to interpret version 3' of Google Glass, Vian said, according to NDTV. Details about what the new versions will look like have not yet been released. Processor company Intel is expected to create the chip in the device.","Massimo Vian, head of Luxottica, says version two 'in preparation'

Scroll down for video . Five staff members left the Royal Easter Show with serious injuries after taking a joy ride on the closed Super Slide . The Easter Show's chief operating officer Michael Collins told Fairfax the slide 'runs way too fast in the wet' and that's why it was closed as soon as the weather turned. It is reported the group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride. A 22-year-old woman broke both her legs, a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and internal bleeding while a 23-year-old woman also broke her leg and a 33-year-old man possibly broke his arm. Three of the contractors escaped without injury. Officials closed the ride earlier that night after deciding heavy rain made the ride particularly dangerous . The 22-year old woman and the 60-year-old man required emergency medical treatment and were taken to Westmead Hospital, while the others sought treatment at Concord Hospital.

That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. ""Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,"" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. ""We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,"" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice.

James Boase, landlord of the Coppa Dolla pub in Broadhempston, Devon had been drinking with a friend in Torquay on March 13, 2014. The 36-year-old publican told Torquay Magistrates' Court that the last thing he could remember was going to bed at approximately 12.30am and then awoke beside his car which had been involved in a car crash.

He insisted he had been 'sleep walking'. However prosecutors insisted he had failed to stop his black Nissan Navara after being involved in a collision with a Citroen Berlingo. Police arrived at Boase's house where they found him standing next to his car. He told the court: 'I remember being confused and slightly frustrated.I honestly don’t know how I got there. 'I remember seeing the car and being completely shocked. I believe I must have gone into my friend’s house and gone to bed. 'At the time I was unaware I had any sort of sleeping disorder. 'There were questions unanswered causing me a lot of problems, I was worried and scared and sought medical help to get some answers.'

At Torquay Magistrates' Court, District Judge Kevin Grey dismissed Boase’s claims of sleepwalking and found him guilty of drink-driving, failing to stop after an accident, failing to report an accident, and driving dangerously.

He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa. Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, also became an iconic wartime figure – and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth. Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time. They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat. Major General Michael Gambier-Parry, of the 2nd Armoured Division, was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili, Libya, in 1941. The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie. The pair shared good wine and smoked ‘excellent cigars’, according to Gambier-Parry’s granddaughter, Liza Donoghue, 67. During the meal, Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat. A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner. And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry’s Army goggles in a staff car, he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed. Scroll down for video .
